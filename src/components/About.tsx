                  Electronics & Communication Engineer
                </h3>
                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  I'm Aniket Jha, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student at VIT Vellore 
                  with a strong passion for embedded systems, hardware design, and intelligent sensing. 
                  I work at the intersection of hardware and softwareâ€”building systems that integrate 
                  sensors, data analysis, and real-world applications.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  My projects include a smart fruit freshness detection system using acoustic, gas, and 
                  moisture sensors; PCB design using KiCad for industrial applications; and FPGA-based 
                  RF front-end development. I'm also gaining experience with cloud platforms like AWS 
                  and building AI-powered solutions using Python and deep learning frameworks.
                </p>

                <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  I'm driven by a goal to create reliable, scalable hardware systems that solve real-world 
                  problems. If you're working on cutting-edge embedded tech or hardware-software integration, 
                  I'd love to collaborate.
                </p>
